# Problem Statement
Youth in rural areas often lack access to structured career guidance due to limited exposure, absence of professional counselors, and poor awareness of skill development opportunities. Many students are unaware of job-oriented courses, government schemes, or online training platforms that could help them build a career aligned with their interests.
Traditional methods of career counseling are not scalable and fail to reach underserved communities, contributing to skill mismatch, underemployment, and loss of potential.

# Proposed Solution
A smart, localized AI agent built on IBM Watsonx.ai and IBM Granite that delivers personalized career guidance using curated, trustworthy information. It supports multilingual interaction and is grounded in ethical principles, helping youth explore career paths aligned with their interests and values.
